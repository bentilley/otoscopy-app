# Otoscopy App

An app for learning about condition of the inner ear.

## Developing

To run the app in devlopment mode, run

```bash
npx react-native start
```

Then in another terminal run either:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

or,

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

Depending on which platform you would like to run development mode in.

## Notes

This app was created following the React Native tutorial. See instructions
followed here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Icons

SVG isn't so easy in app development so the icons are all supplied using a
custom font called _otoicon_.

To add additional icons to the custom font that is used, please see the
instructions in the `components/design/icons/index.tsx` file.
